# Schema.org and I-ADOPT

Schema.org [Schema.org, 2021] is a collaborative community project for supporting the Semantic Web by providing markup schemas that can be embedded in web content to support optimized discovery services.
Schema.org provides the Dataset type which can point to variables measured with the variableMeasured property.
As of the writing of this document, variableMeasured may point to either a text description of a variable or a set of PropertyValue pairs of identifier and description.
A PropertyValue in turn may indicate a propertyID that points to an external vocabulary or web resource that describes that property.
The I-ADOPT framework could provide a possible extension to schema.org by providing a schema for describing properties represented in Datasets.
