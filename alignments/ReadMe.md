# Alignments to other Ontological Frameworks

Below, we review the alignment of the I-ADOPT framework with a selection of ontological frameworks for describing variables or that refer to variables.
These frameworks may be complex and involve many components, so for simplicity, we present only the components that can be mapped to the I-ADOPT framework.

* [Complex Property Model](cpm.md)
* [Extensible Observation Ontology](oboe.md)
* [Observation & Measurements & Samples (OMS)](oms.md)
* [Schema.org](schema_org.md)
* [Scientific Variables Ontology](svo.md)
* [Smart Applications REFerence Ontology](saref.md)
* [SOSA](sosa.md)
