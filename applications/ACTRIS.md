# ACTRIS
The Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure ([ACTRIS] (https://www.actris.eu/)) is the pan-European research infrastructure (RI) producing high-quality data and information on short-lived atmospheric constituents and on the processes leading to the variability of these constituents in natural and controlled atmospheres.

Different semantic artefacts (for variables, instrument types, platform types, quality control) are being created to describe the geoscientific content of data from the ACTRIS sites. For the observed variables the ACTRIS data management team collaborates with the WG I-ADOPT to decompose the description based on the I-ADOPT framework. In addition the observed variable terms will be mapped to CF names.
