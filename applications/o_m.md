# OGC / ISO Observations & Measurements revision

Observations & Measurements (O&M) is an international OGC / ISO (19156) standard that is a cornerstone of many environmental information systems around the globe.
Its implementations also reach out to other domains such as LandSurvey.

At the same time I-ADOPT work was progressing, Observations & Measurements was going through its revision process.
Refining the description of ObservableProperties was part of the discussion on scoping O&M revision (cf. the corresponding [github issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/om-swg/issues/21)).
As a result both teams (O&M + I-ADOPT) joined forces to ensure both models evolve in a coherent direction.

The following steps were taken
* Conceptual level data modelling exercises to ensure semantic consistency and coherence of both models,
* 1st tests on sample instance ‘scenarios’ and on an O&M based API (SensorThings API).

This uptake story will continue through
* Broadened test on comprehensive registries of environmental variables (ex: BRGM,  French Water Information System),
* Broadened test on SensorThings API (ex: Fraunhofer/DataCove implementations).

Note:
* Observations & Measurements is now renamed into Observations, Measurements & Samples
* A [Water Quality Interoperability Experiment](https://external.ogc.org/twiki_public/HydrologyDWG/WaterQualityIE) within the OGC HydroDomainWorkingGroup will leverage the same baseline on conceptual (O&M, I-ADOPT) and technical levels (OGC APIs).
    This exercise will hopefully help continue to test and apply the I-ADOPT model.
    It will also be liaised to the RDA Global Water Information Interest Group (GWIIG).

*Timescale*: 1st half of 2022 (potentially over 2022 and down to 2023 if I-ADOPT work embarked in the upcoming WQ IE).
