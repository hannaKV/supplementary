# EnvThes

EnvThes represents the harmonized vocabulary dealing with environmental observations and is adopted by LTER-Europe, ILTER, and ECOPOTENTIAL.
It provides concepts describing all steps in the data gathering and analysis process starting from the observation sites to the statistical analysis.
In 2018 it underwent a substantial revision following the approach used in the Complex Property Model.

EnvThes consists of the top concepts Object of Interest, Property, Constraint, Matrix (as sub concept of Object of Interest) and Statistical Function (as sub concept of Method), plus additional concepts considered relevant for the LTER community such as Research Focus, Infrastructure (including Device), Method and most importantly Parameter.
Parameter is a compound concept formed by determining an observed property for an object of interest as used by the LTER scientist.
The corresponding atomic concepts Object of Interest, Property, Matrix and Device can be used to break down the compound concept.
EnvThes will now be re-designed regarding the Parameter concept by adopting the I-ADOPT definition of variable.
The first step is to focus on the eLTER Standard Observations, which is a set of 173 chosen parameters which are considered to be of critical relevance for environmental modelling and high sensitivity to environmental changes.
These will be described as I-ADOPT variables decomposed in its atoms using the I-ADOPT associations.
In a second step all other parameters will be re-designed as I-ADOPT variables.
Missing component terms will be also added if considered necessary.

*Timescale*: work on this uptake story will have a first demonstrable output in February/March 2022.
