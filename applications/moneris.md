# MONERIS use case within the OBARIS project

The goal of Project OBARIS is to define the key pillars and artifacts of an auditable, intelligent knowledge management system for the environmental sector.
MONERIS is used as a showcase for auditable analysis of water quality.
MONERIS is a semi-empirical emission model operating on the catchment scale, highly relevant to identify hot spots of nutrient emissions into surface waters.
Quantifying the input of point source emissions as well as emissions from a number of relevant diffuse pathways, like erosion, groundwater or stormwater overflow, MONERIS results are used for water management purposes and contribute to the National River Basin Management Plan.
To enhance the trust and traceability of the MONERIS model environment, the use of an auditable Semantic AI System increases transparency and captures the provenance of the data that results in the pre-processed master variable soil loss.
The Knowledge Graph provides the mechanism to enable semantic interoperability between heterogeneous data coming from different sources, e.g., measurement metrics.
It is crucial to ensure the quality of the integrated KG data since input data quality is critical in both models.
I-ADOPT is used to enrich the Knowledge Graph with precise and FAIR descriptions of the model input data.
